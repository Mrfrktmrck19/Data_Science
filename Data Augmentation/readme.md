# Data Augmentation
## What is Data Augmentation
Data Augmentation is set of techniques to artifically increace the amount of data bt generating new data points from existing data.   <br/>
This includes making small changes to data or using deep learning models to generate new data points. <br/>
##  Why Should we use these techniques?
Machine learning application especially in the deep learning domain continue to diversify and increase rapidly. Data Augmentation techniques may be a good <br/>
tool againist to challanges which artifical intelligence world faces.
Data Augmentation is useful to improve performance and outcomes of machine learning models by forming new and different examples to train datasets. If the dataset in a machine learning model is rich and sufficient, the model performs better and more accurately. <br/>
For machine learning models, collecting and labelling of data can be exhausting and costly processes. <br/>
Transformations in datasets by using data augmentation techniques allow companies to reduce these operational costs.
